These data are used in OCR-ing Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR), these files are made by training different types of images. It is an electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text or we can say you can copy text in mobile phone or computer from image after processing these images in tesseract with these data.
