This section is an experimental production of tessdata for Santali Language.
This Resopository contain tessdata of version:
*3.05.02

### What is the use of these tessdata ?
These data are used in OCR-ing Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR), these files are made by training different types of images. It is an electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text or we can say you can copy text in mobile phone or computer from image after processing these images in tesseract with these data. Which would be time consuming if you would have been typing very long content page.

### How to use them ?
You can use them with tesseract engine or i would recommend you to use a third party software if you are a beginner like me:
1. [Download tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki) if you like coding or,
2. Install a third party software. Tesseract doesn't have a built-in GUI, but there are several available from the 
[3rd party page](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/User-Projects-%E2%80%93-3rdParty). I used gImageReader, it worked well for me.
3. Copy these trained data from any of these respositories and paste it in tessdata directory of gimagereader. Again click on top left corner of gimagereader redetect language and sat (Santali) language will appear. 
4. Input your image having santali writing. Then select recognition language as santali and run. You will get santali text extracted from image.
5. Thats it that the main work of these files.

### Where else can i find tessdata for Santali ?
Their are few but you can find them from [Indic OCR](https://github.com/indic-ocr) they had made for santali also . Actually i was inspired form them for creating my own Santali tessdata. If you have created your Santali tessdata then please tell me.
